*About*

howto_co34pt_liveCode is an attempt to extensively document my live-coding music practice. I live code as coï¿¥ï¾¡pt, mostly making dance music (including for Algoraves), but I have also employed live coding as part of some other projects. This repo contains a number of articles and essays listed in this contents page which cover various aspects of my live coding practice from the ground up, and also contains a number of files to support your use of SuperCollider in the way that I use it. More info about this in 'What This Repo Is'

#+end_quote

The repo belongs to S. Cotterill, a live coder from Newcastle who uses SuperCollider and TidalCycles for music in the electronica/acid genre and gigs at AlgoRaves.
